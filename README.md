-> Composite
-> Hexagonal
-> dissociation between controller and model
-> Search for O(1) and also the fastest implementation

-> Reference https://gist.github.com/halfelf/db1ae032dc34278968f8bf31ee999a25 and blog
--> Which is follows the described in GitHub
--> Similarity to graph problems
--> Order are not immutable
--> void GC
--> Streams and Optional GC
--> Modification to remove comparable interface and add comparable

--> TreeOrderBook - all operations with O(1) amortized.
--> ObjectPool
--> Not tread-safe
--> https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/3783/what-is-an-efficient-data-structure-to-model-order-book
--> Interface missing exception throws

--> PriceLevel
--> Scalability at what cost
--> Property based testing
